code-maker. The code-maker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.
The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers.
The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs. A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the
guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. A - indicates a number match: one of
the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.'
